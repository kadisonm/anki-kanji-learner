<!-- !!! DO NOT EDIT THIS !!! -->

<!--

Your changes will not be saved as the plugin will overwrite/add any missing fields every time you open Anki or change the plugin settings.

However, custom css within the styling tab will work though (no guarantees). If your changes do not show, try adding !important to the property.

Note: Editing any css within this file will not work.
